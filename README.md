This IoT Energy Meter project measures real-time voltage, current, power, energy, and power factor, with built-in Power Factor Correction (PFC). When the power factor drops below a set threshold, the system automatically switches capacitor banks using relays to improve efficiency and reduce reactive power loss. Data is sent to a cloud platform via WiFi for remote monitoring through a web or mobile dashboard.
